# Pet Adoption Platform

Welcome to my Pet Adoption Platform. This project was created to hone my full-stack development skills, incorporating Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Below you'll find an overview of the features, technologies used, and how to set up and run the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for running JavaScript code.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing pet and user data in a flexible JSON-like format.
